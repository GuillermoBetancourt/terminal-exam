# Test description

Display player information as cards in a grid matching the following mock.

Use player data available via `usePlayersAsync()`.

#### Note:

- Most player games have `accurate date`, when available this should be favored over their `date`.

#### Done when:

- UI matches the mock
- Players' cards are sorted by date of their latest game played.
- There are tests that give sufficient confidence to this screen.
- (If all the above is done, see the bonus note)
